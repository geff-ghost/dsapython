##creating a test case

 Create a test case which takes in a list of tests, and a function, it should print out all the test cases that passed and all that failed

 1 #State the problem clearly and identify inputs and outputs

our function should take in tests(a list of test) and a function(the function that executes all the tests)

def test_cases(tests, function):
    pass

 the function(test_cases) should loop through all the elements in the tests ie(for elem in tests)

 after obtaining the elements in the list it should access all the inputs and outputs of the elements in the list 
 ie test = {
    'input' :{
        'nums' = []
    },
    'output' : 
 }

 these values (input and output) should be passed as agruments in the function( binary_search() )

 our function(test_cases) should print out all the tests that passed and all the tests that failed
